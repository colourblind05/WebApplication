<h3>What is Astrology?</h3>

<p class="paragraph">Astrology is the study of the influence that distant cosmic objects, usually stars and planets, have on human lives. The position of the sun, stars, moon and planets at the time of people's birth (not their conception) is said to shape their personality, affect their romantic relationships and predict their economic fortunes, among other divinations.</p>

<p class="paragraph">What most people know about astrology is their "sign," which refers to one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac. This is a form of sun-sign astrology, which is the astrology upon which newspaper horoscopes are based. It is probably the simplest form, because nothing more than the date of someone's birthday is needed to generate a sun-sign horoscope. Many astrologers will tell you that this form of astrology is so simplistic that it produces very limited results.<p>

<p class="paragraph">To produce a more accurate reading, astrologers check to see what sign each planet was in at the time of birth. The planets and signs combine with other elements, such as houses and angles, to form a complex and often very specific profile of a subject's personality, life and future prospects.</p>

<p class="paragraph">There is no single unified theory or practice of astrology. Ancient cultures all practiced their own forms, some of which combined and evolved into today's common western astrology. Eastern cultures continue to practice their own forms of astrology: Chinese, Vedic and Tibetan astrology are among the most well-known.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Even within western astrology, there is a considerable diversity of methods and philosophies. Some divide astrology by the end result that is intended:</p>

<ul class="paragraph"><li><b>Mundane Astrology</b> - This is used to examine world events and make predictions about national affairs, wars and economies.</li></ul>

<ul class="paragraph"><li><b>Interrogatory Astrology</b> - This branch can be further subdivided, but generally refers to astrology that seeks to make specific predictions or analyses about the subject's objectives or events within the subject's life.</li></ul>

<ul class="paragraph"><li><b>Natal Astrology</b> - This is what most people think of when they think of astrology. Natal Astrology seeks to make predictions and analyses based on the date of a person's birth. It's based on the idea that everything that happens to something is expressed at the very beginning of that thing, sometimes known as the Law of Beginnings.</li></ul><br>


<h3>Astrology vs Horoscope</h3>

<p class="paragraph">Do you know the difference between astrology and horoscopes? If not, I guess you are more familiar with horoscopes because the Internet and printed materials frequently have some talk or sections about the daily or regular horoscope readings.</p>

<p class="paragraph">By definition, &quotastrology&quot is more of a study of the positions of the celestial bodies in the sky. In this sense, many regard it as a form of science or pseudoscience. Some astrology experts also highlight it as a form of belief that the aforementioned planetary positions have some direct effects on the development of human affairs and the occurrence of earthly natural phenomena. There are actually many types of astrology. The most common form is probably Western and Chinese Astrology.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Moreover, others interpret astrology as the obsolete version of modern-day astronomy. The astronomy we know today is actually derived from one of the two main divisions of ancient astrology which is the horary astrology. This division measures the movement of heavenly bodies. This later became important for the creation of the other division-judiciary astrology, which is best known (even up to this day) for its use in seeking trends and offering predictions (more inclined with horoscopes).</p>

<p class="paragraph">By contrast, a horoscope is a diagram, chart, or graphical representation of the heavens. This graph or chart shows the positions of the planets and the zodiac signs. These diagrams are used by horoscope enthusiasts in the computation of births and the art of foretelling the future events of one&#39s life. Being guided by such, a person can be advised to act in a particular behavior so as to make his day better. Some are arguing about the significance of horoscopes because several studies were made to verify their validity only to find out that most, if not all, ended up being false.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Etymologically, a horoscope is taken from the Greek term &quothoroskopos&quot, which can be translated to &quotlooking at the hours&quot. It is very related to astrology because, per its definition, it makes use of the concept of astrology on planetary positions across space. When you study astrology, you will eventually go deep into horoscopes. However, if you study horoscopes, it is not always guaranteed that you will learn all of the focal points of astrology.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Summary:</p>

<ol class="paragraph"><li>Astrology is regarded as a pseudoscience that the belief that the planets&#39 respective positions in space have some effect on human affairs and natural Earthly phenomena. It is more of a study.</li>
<li>Horoscopes are more of a chart or diagram that make use of astrology concepts. They serve as guides for people on how they should act or behave. To some degree, it also serves to foretell some parts of one&#39s future.</li>
<li>Some are skeptical with the use and validity of horoscopes. It is derived from the Greek word &quothoroskopos&quot, which means &quotlooking at the hours&quot.</li></ol>

<h3>Astrological Consultations</h3>

<p class="paragraph">There are several different applications of astrology, and determining which one would best suit your needs is the first step in setting up a consultation.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Below you will find a list of some of the different types of astrological consultations that I offer, as well as what they entail.<p>

<h4>Natal Astrology</h4>

<p class="paragraph">Natal astrology is the practice of determining information about the nature and course of a person&#39s life based on the study of the positions of the planets at the moment that they were born. This involves the analysis of the client&#39s &quotbirth chart&quot or &quotnatal chart&quot, which is a diagram that depicts where the planets were at the exact moment of their birth. Consultations involving a client&#39s birth chart are useful for determining wide-ranging information about different areas of their life.</p>

<h4>Birth Time Rectification</h4>

<p class="paragraph">Birth time rectification is used in order to determine when a person was born, when the birth time is otherwise unknown. This is important because without a birth time, you cannot accurately calculate a person&#39s birth chart. By comparing important dates in a person&#39s life with the different potential birth charts, we are able to infer the probable moment of birth.</p>

<h4>Birth Time Rectification</h4>

<p class="paragraph">Electional astrology is used in order to determine an auspicious moment to begin a new venture or undertaking. It is a more proactive application of astrology that is used in order to enable a person to take a more participatory role in the unfolding of their own destiny. Electional astrology can be applied to a broad variety of ventures and undertakings, from something as simple as taking a trip, to other more serious issues such as getting married or starting a new business.</p>
